<p>
    This project is a demonstration of how to migrate an AngularJS app from
    a hand-spun build process to webpack.
</p>
<p>
    The project will begin by using gulp to create a custom build script to
    concatenate and minify the JavaScript, copy files into place, etc.
</p>
<p>
    Then, the project will be converted step-by-step to using webpack as
    the main build tool. Gulp may still be used, but the application
    bundling should all be handled by webpack.
