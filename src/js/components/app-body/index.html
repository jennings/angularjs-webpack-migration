<p>
    This project is a demonstration of how to migrate an AngularJS app from
    a hand-spun build process to webpack.
</p>

<h2>Bundling JavaScript</h2>
<p>
    The JavaScript is bundled using a gulp task. The task searches for
    files matching the following patterns:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>node_modules/jquery/dist/jquery.js</code></li>
    <li><code>node_modules/boostrap/dist/js/bootstrap.js</code></li>
    <li><code>node_modules/angular/angular.js</code></li>
    <li><code>src/app.js</code></li>
    <li><code>src/**/*.js</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    Files matching those patterns are concatenated, minified, then bundled into
    a single file named <code>bundle.js</code>.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>The order of those files matters</strong>; Bootstrap cannot load
    until jQuery does, and none of the components can load until
    <code>app.js</code> does, since that's where our AngularJS module is
    declared.
</p>

<h2>Compiling templates</h2>
<p>
    The AngularJS templates are compiled and added to the template cache by the
    npm package <code>gulp-angular-templatecache</code>. The output of that
    plugin is concatenated with the rest of the JavaScript before minification.
</p>

<h2>CSS</h2>
<p>
    Any files matching the following patterns are fed to
    <code>gulp-sass</code>:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><code>node_modules/boostrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css</code></li>
    <li><code>src/**/*.scss</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
    The output of <code>gulp-sass</code> is concatenated and saved to
    <code>bundle.css</code>.
</p>
<p>
    Again, <strong>the order of bundling matters</strong>. Styles defined in
    later stylesheets override those in previous ones. If we had many SCSS
    files, we could run into issues where they don't get concatenated in the
    order we expect.
</p>

<h2>Development server</h2>
<p>
    The development server is Browsersync. Once all the JavaScript, CSS, and
    other assets are bundled and placed in <code>./dist</code>,
    Browsersync serves files out of that directory.
</p>
<p>
    A gulp watch is placed on the input files. If any change, the appropriate
    gulp task is executed, then Browsersync reloads the page in the browser.
</p>
